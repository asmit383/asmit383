# 👋 Hi, I’m Asmit Roy

I build things — mostly **intelligent systems** and **robust backend services**.  
My interests live around Machine Learning, distributed systems, and IoT devices that talk to each other.

If it's data-driven, automation-heavy, or performance critical, I'm probably experimenting with it.

### Some things I am trying to be better at 🔧
-Maintaining a structured workflow to stay productive and deliver high-quality work.
